This game is a simple game similar to the popular game Vampire Survivors. You walk around the map, defeat enemies, collect xp, level up, and gather a bunch of auto-targeting weapons to better combat your enemies.
Currently, I do not know whether this game will end up being fully finished, as this is more of an experiment with Godot, GDScript, and game development in general.
If you wish to play the game in its most current state, you can email me at jacob.p.cristo@gmail.com, and I can send you the game :^)
