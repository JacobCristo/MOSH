This game is a simple game similar to the popular game Vampire Survivors. You walk around the map, defeat enemies, collect xp, level up, and gather a bunch of auto-targeting weapons to better combat your enemies.
Currently, I do not know whether this game will end up being fully finished, as this is more of an experiment with Godot, GDScript, and game development in general.
If you wish to play the game you can locate the RUNNABLE folder after downloading the code, which should contain the .exe for the game.
